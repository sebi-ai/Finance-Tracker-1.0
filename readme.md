## 🚀 How to Run the Project

**For Judges/Reviewers:** Please follow these steps to ensure proper functionality:

### ⚡ Option 1: Standalone Version (RECOMMENDED FOR JUDGES)
**Simply open `finance-tracker-standalone.html` in any modern browser!**
- ✅ All CSS and JavaScript embedded - no external files needed
- ✅ Works by double-clicking the file
- ✅ No web server required
- ✅ 100% guaranteed to work in any environment

### Option 2: Using a Local Web Server 
1. Open a terminal/command prompt in the project folder
2. Run one of these commands:
   - Python: `python -m http.server 8000` or `python3 -m http.server 8000`
   - Node.js: `npx http-server`
   - PHP: `php -S localhost:8000`
3. Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8000`

### Option 3: Direct File Opening (Original Version)
1. Make sure all files are in the correct folder structure:
   ```
   Finance-Tracker/
   ├── index.html
   ├── finance-tracker-standalone.html  ← USE THIS FOR JUDGES
   ├── start.html
   ├── css/
   │   └── style.css
   └── js/
       └── app.js
   ```
2. Try opening `start.html` first for compatibility check
3. If styling doesn't appear, try opening in a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**If the page appears unstyled or non-functional:**
- Check if files are in correct folders (css/style.css and js/app.js)
- Try refreshing the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Open browser developer tools (F12) and check for any error messages
- Ensure you're not opening the HTML file from a zip archive
